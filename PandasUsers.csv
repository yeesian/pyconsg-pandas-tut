My research interests span a wide range of topics in urban and regional analysis, with a focus on spatial-temporal dynamics, complexity, and spatial interaction. My previous PhD research examined the impact of commuting flows on the formation of local labour markets, and highlighted the necessity of considering commuting within the context of local labour market spatial structure. My current and future research interests fall under the general banner of `complexity in urban systems’ and encompass interdisciplinary research into topics such as emergence and the multi-scale nature of commuting, the dynamics of housing markets, transportation modelling, as well as more social concepts, such as visible expressions of homelessness and local labour markets. I am particularly interested in movements and flows of individuals, information, and commodities within urban environments, as well as the development and implementation of novel spatial analysis methods and software aimed at characterizing these flows.</p>

In my spare time (a concept worth a laugh), I am the VP of Technology at Industrial Interface, Inc., a web-based b2b startup.
<p>In both roles I administer and develop for the LAMP stack, particularly using CakePHP for the web programming side due to its rapid prototyping abilities.  I obsess over performance more than I should for each of these projects; however, as Cake has such a large footprint, I am starting to eliminate prematuring optimization from my list of sins.
<p>I try never to stop learning, but am also trying to produce more output (create data, rather than just consuming it).  To that end, I have additional side projects in Python that I'd like to eventually publish.</p>
