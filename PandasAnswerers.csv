My common Stack Overflow blurbs for fast reference...</p>

<ul>

<li>Stack Overflow is dedicated to programming questions (including Facebook application programming); however, we *can not assist with non-programming Facebook support issues*. Please review your support options at [Facebook Support](http://facebook.com/help) and [Facebook Developers](http://www.facebook.com/groups/fbdevelopers/)</li>

<li>You will probably get better answers 
on [sf] or [unix.SE]; if you repost to one of
them, please delete this question since we 
strongly discourage cross-posting.</li>

<li>Your accept rate is rather low for the number of questions you have asked.  Please consider accepting past answers that have been useful to you; you can do this by clicking the grey-outlined check mark just underneath the useful answer's score box.</li>

<li>Upvotes are not for correcting downvotes. It is not your job to take away somebody else's right to vote. Only upvote if you thought that it was a great question/answer, not because you disagreed with somebody else's downvote.</li>

<li>@newperson, accepting answers helps you and others. For you: 1) get +2 for every accept. 2) Your accept rate looks better, so people think it's more worth their time to answer your question. For others: 1) Someone took time to answer your question, even if you thought you might be asking a dumb question; give credit to the useful answer so the next person with the same question can find the answer. 2) They get +15 for the answer. 3) Accepting answers improves the overall quality of StackOverflow.</li>

<p>Sadly, my most voted-up answer on Stackoverflow (312 votes) belonged to a question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.hewgill.com/questions/242/068/9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">that later got deleted.</a> The question came from a girl that asked for something cute that she could put on the icing of a birthday cake for her programmer boyfriend.</p>

<p>I suggested that, if her boyfriend is somewhat mathematically inclined, she write the following:</p>

<pre><code>    sin(t) √|cos(t)|
r = __________________  - 2 sin(t) + 2
    sin(t) + 7/5
</code></pre>

<p>If he doesn't get it at first, she could tease him with saying that it is obvious that he should take the polar plot of it. If he still doesn't get it, she should tell him to enter it in <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar%20r=%28sin%28t%29%2asqrt%28abs%28cos%28t%29%29%29%29/%28sin%28t%29%20%2b%207/5%29%20-2%2asin%28t%29%20%2b%202"" rel=""nofollow"">WolframAlpha</a>, that should yield the result:</p>

Currently I'm part of a small team developing software related to geophysics - I guess you could call it a consultancy, but really we're just people that understand what you need and then - importantly! - make it.</p>
